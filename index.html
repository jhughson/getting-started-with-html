<p><b>HTML</b>  = Main document type on the internet.  It stands for Hyper 
Text Markup Language.  <b>Hyperlinks</b> glue the web together.</p>
<p><b>Major Pieces of the Web</b> include 1. You 2. Your computer 
3. Internet 4. Servers</p>
<p><b>HTML</b> is made up of 1.Text 2.Markup (what it looks like), 3.References to 
documents 4.Links to other pages.</p>
<p><b>HTML Attributes</b> example:<tag attr = "value"> contents</tag> or example:
<a href="www.reddit.com">Reddit</a> where href= attribute name and url = value.</p>
<p><b>Other examples include:</b> "br", "span", "strong", and img src" which links to an image source, here is an example from my small but famous city:<p><img src ="http://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/presidents/images/site19a.jpg"alt"OOPS! Image not found"><br>Abraham Lincoln's Tomb, Springfield, IL</p>
<p><b>Inline and Block:</b> Elements are Inline or Block.  Inline examples: span,a,br,img and strong.  Block examples: div,p and form</p>
<p>Computers understand their language literally which requires the programmer to pay attention to every detail and it's impact to the final product, user experience and overall value.</p>
